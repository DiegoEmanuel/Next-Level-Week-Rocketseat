## 🚀 How to execute the project

This project is divided into three parts:
1. Backend (server folder)
2. Frontend (web folder)
3. Mobile (mobile folder)

💡 Both Frontend and Mobile need the Backend to be running to work.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Expo-Cli](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/).
You will also need to have the Expo application installed on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=pt_BR)
or [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779).


In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
